# PUZZLED
What do you do after you're finished assembling a puzzle? If you're anything like me, you probably hate the idea of just taking it apart after hours of working on it and then putting it back in the box to collect dust on a shelf somewhere in your living room. You feel the same way? Thought so! Well, there's good news: I have created a web application designed to keep your puzzles alive for longer by providing a platform for uploading and keeping track of the puzzles you've completed, as well as sharing and exchanging your puzzles with others in the community! Why have your puzzle collecting dust, when you could be giving it a second, third, fourth, etc life by letting others have the same fun with it as you did!

Welcome to Puzzled...it's great to see you!
